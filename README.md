# DateTimeSpan

You want to represent, compare and manipulate timespans. A timespan
runs from one point in time to another, e.g. from 15:30 today until
09:00 tomorrow./home/ravi/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication

You've just found a li/home/ravi/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplicationbrary that claims to do the job, but it doesn't
have any tests.

## Write tests

Write tests to gain confidence that the following methods work as you
would expect:

  * Equality checking (==)
  * isStrictlyWithin()
  * intersects()
